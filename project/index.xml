      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;parkrun is an international movement which organises free weekly 5km running events. It has been widely praised for encouraging inactive individuals to participate in physical activity. Recently, parkrun received funding to establish 200 new events across England, specifically targeted at deprived communities. This project aims to support the parkrun&amp;rsquo;s extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted ecological spatial analyses, using data on 455 parkrun events, 2,842 public green spaces, and 32,844 English census areas. Poisson regression was applied to investigate the relationships between the distances to events, index of multiple deprivation, and other area characteristics, and parkrun participation rates. We ran a location-allocation analysis, to identify optimal locations for future events, and developed an interactice online map to explore the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;Objective&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In breast cancer patients, treatment at the end of life accounts for a major share of medical spending. However, little is known about the variability of cost trajectories between patients. This study aims to identify underlying latent groups of advanced breast cancer patients with similar cost trajectories over the last year before death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;methods&#34;&gt;Methods&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from deceased advanced breast cancer patients, diagnosed between 2010 and 2017, were retrieved from the Southeast Netherlands Advanced Breast Cancer (SONABRE) Registry. Costs of hospital care over the last twelve months before death were analyzed, and the variability of longitudinal patterns between patients were explored using group-based trajectory modeling. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were applied to investigate differences between the identified latent groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 558 patients. Over the last twelve months before death, mean hospital costs were €2,255 (SD = €492) per month. Costs increased over the last five months and reached a maximum of €3,614 in the last month of life, driven by hospital admissions, while spending for medication declined over the last three months of life. Based on patients’ individual cost trajectories, we identified six latent groups with distinct longitudinal patterns, of which only two showed a marked increase in costs over the last twelve months before death. Latent groups were constituted of heterogeneous patients, and clinical characteristics explained membership only to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average costs of advanced breast cancer patients increased towards the end of life. However, we uncovered several latent groups of patients with divergent cost trajectories, which did not reflect the overall increasing trend. The mechanisms underlying the variability in cost trajectories warrants further research.&lt;/p&gt;
