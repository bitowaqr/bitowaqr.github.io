Schneider","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Summary In economic evaluations of health technologies, health outcomes are commonly measured in terms of QALYs. QALYs are the product of time and health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life, in turn, is determined by a social tariff, which is supposed to reflect the public\u0026rsquo;s preference over health states. This paper argues that, because of the tariff\u0026rsquo;s role in the societal decision making process, it should not be understood as merely an operational (statistical) definition of health, but as a major instrument of democratic participation. I outline what implications this might have for both the method used to aggregate individual preferences, and the set of individuals whose preferences should count. Alternative tariff specifications and decision rules are explored, and future research directions are proposed.\n","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"4f813ed323662e1bb36b910a511fa409","permalink":"https://bitowaqr.github.io/project/dem_soc/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dem_soc/","section":"project","summary":"In this paper I argue that the valuation of health states should not be understood as merely a statistical exercise, but as major instrument of democratic participation.

Resulting utility values, measured on a scale that is anchored at full health and dead, are commonly aggregated across individuals, in order to derive a social value set. Here, we argue that this aggregation procedure is problematic, because it fails to take into account that TTO utility values are not only determined by an individual’s preference for the quality, but also for the quantity of life. As a consequence, when health state utilities are aggregated across different individuals, individuals with a wider range of utility values have – simply for arithmetic reasons – more weight in the estimation of the social value set. Inspired by relative utilitarianism, we propose an alternative aggregation procedure, to equalise individuals’ weights in the estimation of social health state values. We apply the alternative procedure to an EQ-5D 3L data set and compare the results against the conventional social tariff.\n","date":1580428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580428800,"objectID":"56241272bb7606ef434470818ef1c9a5","permalink":"https://bitowaqr.github.io/project/scaling/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scaling/","section":"project","summary":"This project is concerned with the interpersonal (in)comparability of (TTO) health state utilities.

However, little is known about the variability of cost trajectories between patients. This study aims to identify underlying latent groups of advanced breast cancer patients with similar cost trajectories over the last year before death.\nMethods Data from deceased advanced breast cancer patients, diagnosed between 2010 and 2017, were retrieved from the Southeast Netherlands Advanced Breast Cancer (SONABRE) Registry. Costs of hospital care over the last twelve months before death were analyzed, and the variability of longitudinal patterns between patients were explored using group-based trajectory modeling. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were applied to investigate differences between the identified latent groups.\nResults We included 558 patients. Over the last twelve months before death, mean hospital costs were €2,255 (SD = €492) per month. Costs increased over the last five months and reached a maximum of €3,614 in the last month of life, driven by hospital admissions, while spending for medication declined over the last three months of life. Based on patients’ individual cost trajectories, we identified six latent groups with distinct longitudinal patterns, of which only two showed a marked increase in costs over the last twelve months before death. Latent groups were constituted of heterogeneous patients, and clinical characteristics explained membership only to a limited extent.\nConclusions The average costs of advanced breast cancer patients increased towards the end of life. However, we uncovered several latent groups of patients with divergent cost trajectories, which did not reflect the overall increasing trend. The mechanisms underlying the variability in cost trajectories warrants further research.\n","date":1586390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586390400,"objectID":"053148fa57eba84d7b4dfa9524b1c18f","permalink":"https://bitowaqr.github.io/project/cost-trajectories/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cost-trajectories/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring (latent) cost trajectories in patients with advanced breast cancer in the Netherlands during the last year of life, using group-based trajectory modelling and real world-data from a regional cancer registry.","tags":null,"title":"Cost trajectories","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Summary A R tutorial on how to access your personal fitbit data and analyse your sleeping patterns.\n","date":1291420800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1291420800,"objectID":"c58f957ad20435f2cef9a71f9ecced69","permalink":"https://bitowaqr.github.io/project/fitbitr/","publishdate":"2010-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fitbitr/","section":"project","summary":"A R tutorial on how to access your personal fitbit data and analyse your sleeping patterns.","tags":null,"title":"fitbitR","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"879fa607477f8d058a51ada1aa552755","permalink":"https://bitowaqr.github.io/project/quape/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quape/","section":"project","summary":"This study investigates the association between staffing (nurses and physicians) and the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in acute care hospitals in Germany.","tags":null,"title":"Staffing and the quality of care in German hospitals","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"https://bitowaqr.github.io/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
